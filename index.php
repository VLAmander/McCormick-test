      <p>In-game there are currently over 150 spaceships and 15 different ship manufactures, the ships range from small sub fighters to massive capital ships that are over 400 meters in length,  each ship has an exterior and interior design each ship is operated in the first person view the smaller ships may just have the cockpit to look around larger ship may have corridors food halls and living area to players, every ship can have a custom loadout of weapons missiles and even the interiors of the ships some more than others, large ships travel faster in quantum travel then smaller ships but are slower in normal space and are not as nimble requiring 3 or more players to operate.    </p>
